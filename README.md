# Binary Search And Selection Sort
Algorithm binary search

# What is Binary Search?
- Is a Algorithm that need a list sorted, for search a element, fast and in a elegant way,
this divide the array in the middle until the middle element is the element that you want
to find, if this element don't be found, the low position (or left position) in array is greater then
high, so this function return "the element don't exists", otherwise it finds the position of the element and returns.

# What is a Selection Sort?
- Is a Algorithm for sort a list.
- Complexity: O(nÂ²)
- Selection sort consists in read a list and create another
list to add elements in order.
